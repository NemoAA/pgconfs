%%% PostgreSQL Conference Europe 2013, Dublin, Oct 31, 2013
%%%
%%% A presentation of some tooling I'm building to take care of all the
%%% boring steps of the migration in a single easy and fast step: schema,
%%% handling types and default values, auto-increment and sequences, data,
%%% constraints, indexes.
%%%
%%% That feature set actually works already, only missing is a little glue
%%% and a user language to drive the tool, and that's in good progress
%%% already. The tool would definitely be ready for a full demo at the
%%% conference.
%%%
%%% Obviously the tool licence of choice is "The PostgreSQL Licence".
%%% Actually it's part of the new version of pgloader
