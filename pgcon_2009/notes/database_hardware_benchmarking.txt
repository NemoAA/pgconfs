= Database Hardware Benchmarking

- always benchmark new hardware *before* production
- allows better trouble shooting if you trust the hardware

== Systematic benchmarking

- memory setup can be wrong
- test mem, cpu, disk, database, application
- memtest86+, sysbench, hdparm (non portable results)

=== memtest86+

- memory bandwith speed
- memory setup reliable when memtest86+ release newer than hardware

=== sysbench

- write test, the read caches

=== sources for slow memory results

- cpu / motherboard : clocks have to be integer multipliers away
- single channel ram (slots)
- motherboard bios settings (SPD/timing/voltage)

=== cpu tests

- sysbench
- generate_series()
- pgbench select-only

=== sources for slow CPU results

- Power management!
- linux cpu governor

=== disk tests

- test commit fsync rate (write cache enabled and system lying about it)
- data physical location (begining of the disk is on the external, faster) 
  use zcav from bonnie++
