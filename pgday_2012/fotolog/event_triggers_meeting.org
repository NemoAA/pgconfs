* Event Triggers Dinner
** First patch next month
*** Try skipping any definitional issues
*** Catalog, pg_dump, syntax
*** a single event managed: ddl_command_start
*** hooked in utility.c, no specific code in commands code
*** not providing any specific trigger paramaters
*** ok to support global objects
*** error management (event/command couple not supported)
*** limited subcommands handling
*** actively prevent firing CREATE SEQUENCE event for SERIAL
*** docs with discussion about (sub)commands and event support

** Then implement new events, one at a time
